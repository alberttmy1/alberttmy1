### ðŸ’¬ About Me:

My name is Kevin Loaiza, I am the first generation in my family line to be able to go to university. I come from a long line of farmers and it has been a great blessing in order to be able to get an education. I am originally from Las Vegas, Nevada and moved to Colorado about 18 years ago, but I still go back to visit family. Regardless, I have come to love Colorado and it's way more comfortable to be outside!
I hope to be able to present to you a visual colorful presentation of my digital portfolio so that you get a better understanding of who I am. Along with it will be a list of projects that I am proud of and enjoyed working on over the years while attending the university. Paired with my project will be programs that I have used and I am comfortable utilizing. There will also be a pdf of my resume and links to my social media platforms that give a better perspective of who I am in a public space.

### ðŸ’¡ Interest

I used to volunteer a lot at my middle school and elementary school. I was a teacher's assistant and I found it pleasant teaching others. I mainly worked with students who were in the process of learning English and would grade their work or help translate writings. I still keep in contact with some of the teachers and it has been fulfilling even going back and seeing familiar faces.

In order to get out of the house and be able to enjoy nature I dearly enjoy the outdoors that Colorado provides. Since my move to this state I have done many activities with my family. All the way from mountain biking, hiking, swimming, camping, fishing, and boat rowing.

As I became more interested in technology I couldnâ€™t let go of playing video games. Along the way to picking my career I became more interested in computers and have found it interesting and fun to build my own rigs. I have built two pcâ€™s so far, one that was a budget build and another one that I saved up my money for in order to get better performance than what I was using before.

### ðŸš€ Projects

An academic project that is still a work in progress and is still being done this year is my capstone project for NASA. The goal of the project is to model our solar system while projecting a travel path of a spacecraft through our solar system. There is no link to that github repo right now and will be public by the end of April 2023. 

Using a messaging platform called Discord we made a bot which is an extension of the application's capabilities. Now this bot integrated our very own gacha game and tracked the crypto Dogecoin with an API. All of these functions are called through commands called in a text-channel. 

Another project that I have worked on this year was with a partner for object oriented programming. We made a snakes and ladders game that was made in intelliJ where we used Java. The purpose of the game is to reach tile 100 in a 10x10 grid where there are various obstacles that could increase the number of tiles you go up, which are stairs or go back if you land on the head of a snake to the tail. Each players takes turn rolling a die until they reach the final tile.
